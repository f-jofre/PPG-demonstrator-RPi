PPG-demonstrator-RPi
====================

PPG demonstrator based on the RPi and a RaspiCam

This demonstrator can extract a photoplethysmographic signal from a video recording of the forehead of a person.

Both the compiled and source code are available. Also, scripts for comiling and record the working video are presented.

===============
File breakdown:
  main.cpp   > source code
  main       > executable (run as ./main)
  compile.sh > compile source code
  execute.sh > will perform video recording and conversion and then will run main
